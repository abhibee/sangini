                Andhra Pradesh is one of the 28
                states of India, situated in the south-eastern part of the country. It is the eight-largest state in
                India, covering an area of 162,975 km2 (62,925 sq mi).[4 As per the 2011 census, it is the
                tenth-most populous state, with 49,386,799 inhabitants. The largest city in Andhra Pradesh is
                Visakhapatnam.
                Telugu, one of the classical languages of India,[10 is the major and official language of Andhra
                Pradesh.

                The north-western portion of Andhra Pradesh was separated to form the new
                state of Telangana on 2 June 2014, and Hyderabad, the longtime
                capital of Andhra Pradesh, was transferred to Telangana as part of the division. However, in
                accordance with the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Hyderabad was to remain the acting
                capital of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states for a period of time not exceeding ten years.
