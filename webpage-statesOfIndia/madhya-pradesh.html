                Madhya Pradesh
                is a state in central India. Its capital is Bhopal, and the largest
                city is Indore, with Gwalior, Jabalpur and Ujjain being the other major cities. Madhya Pradesh
                is the second largest Indian state by area and the fifth largest state by population with over
                75 million residents. It borders the states of Uttar Pradesh to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to
                the southeast, Maharashtra to the south, Gujarat to the west, and Rajasthan to the northwest.
                Before 2000, when Chhattisgarh was a part of Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh was the largest
                state in India and the distance between the two furthest points inside the state, Singoli and Konta,
                was 1500 km.
